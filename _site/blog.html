We aim to evaluate how interaction changes in the VR environment. Do people interact more? Do people interact with people/groups they don't normally interact with? Do the users feel like they communicate on a 'better' level? How does the interaction influence the users' understanding and acceptance of other people's practices and beliefs? Some of these questions are more on the objective while others are purely subjective. When it comes to variables like the 'time spent talking' or 'religions of people a user talks to', we can automatically collect data by measuring times users talked to other people and storing the religions of the users. When it comes to variables like the 'quality of an interaction' or 'acceptance/understanding', people might define "good communication" differently which makes it impossible to collect data automatically. In these cases we need direct and personal feedback from the users.</p></div></div></div><div class="item"><div class="image"><div> <img src="/knowledge.jpeg" /><p>Engagement with the environment</p><!-- <span> Engagement </span> --></div></div><div class="details"><div><h1>Knowledge and Engagement</h1><p>Interaction can also happen between user and environment.

If users are given the opportunity to engage with objects they cannot engage with in realtiy, do the take it? Would people make use of 'supernatural' (e.g., lifting really heavy objects) powers? Does interaction with the VR space positively influence understanding of the topic? For question that ask 'do the users use this?' we can automatically collect data by storing if these objects are used.

Do they feel less lonely than with other digital possibilities (e.g. walking around a 3D space only on a screen)? Do they feel more connected to their own faith through these experiences?

In many cases it is hard to motivate children to learn about something because they find it boring or find it hard to concentrate. VR provides the possibility to introduce a higher level of 'playfulness' to the learning process than, e.g., watching a video. The possibility to actually walk around the space and experience objects by actively touching them or even play with them might increase their interest in things. These aspects are mostly subjective as well. To answer these questions we need to define terms like 'better'. It might be defined as 'learns more' but 'learning less but with a deeper understanding' might be a sensible definition as well. A few aspects that can be collected automatically are for example the amount of 'visitation time' vs. 'interaction time' (i.e., did the user just pass time or did they actually interact with other objects/people?) or storing if objects that cannot be interacted with in reality (e.g., a very old book) are interacted with when given the opportunity.</p></div></div></div><div class="item"><div class="image"><div> <img src="/ethical.jpeg" /><p>Keeping ethical beliefs in mind</p><!-- <span> 08.12.2016 </span> --></div></div><div class="details"><div><h1>Ethical Considerations</h1><p>While a lot can be done in VR, maybe not everything should be done. There are members of religious communities that feel very strongly about the physical presence of the sacred spaces and the people.

A study could try to answer the question 'Do people accept a VR environment as a substitute for the real-world?'.
